# 🚀 OSS Match | Open-Source Discovery Platform

**OSS Match** is a high-performance system designed to connect developers with impactful open-source opportunities. By orchestrating the GitHub REST API with advanced caching and rate-limiting layers, it provides a seamless discovery experience tailored to a developer's specific skill set.

This project focuses on the "Deploy" and "Scale" pillars of real-world software—utilizing **Docker**, **Redis**, and **type-safe database architecture**.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture & Performance

- **API Orchestration:** Deep integration with the **GitHub REST API** to fetch, aggregate, and filter real-time issue data.
- **Latency Optimization:** Implemented **Upstash Redis** as a caching layer to reduce redundant API calls and drastically improve response times.
- **Traffic Management:** Integrated **Upstash Rate Limiting** to protect system resources and ensure fair usage for unauthenticated users.
- **Containerized Workflow:** Fully architected with **Docker** for consistent environment parity between development and production.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure OAuth Flow:** GitHub-native authentication powered by **NextAuth.js**.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Matching:** Advanced discovery logic filtering by labels (e.g., `good first issue`) and technical stacks.
- ⚡ **Type-Safe Data Layer:** Robust schema management using **Prisma ORM** and **PostgreSQL**.
- 📝 **Validated Interfaces:** Accessible, schema-validated forms built with **React Hook Form** and **Zod**.
